# Gecko
## An any terrain cylindrical robot for search and exploration missions 

Search and exploration missions have been of great research interest for a long time. Introducing Gecko a mobile robot, that is specifically designed to take on missions in rough and uneven terrains. The cylindrical structure and special wheel design allows it to go though tight spaces and even operate when the bot topple over. The bot can perform complex maneuvers like right and left hopping besides the common forward backward, left, right, stop. The wheel design prevents gecko from getting trapped in any loose surfaces like sand. Gecko is powered with two high torque servo motors that provide the required force to traverse uneven terrain. The advantage of using Gecko design over regular rectangular chassis and four wheel drive is that the later gets stuck when the gaps are tight and has difficulty in maneuvering loose ground. A live camera feed present on the front of gecko provides real-time visual updates.

The prototype of this robot has been developed.

1. 1x Arduino uno
2. 1x lipo cell 
3. 2x 1.8kg/cm servo motor
4. 1x bluetooth controller (HC06)
5. Jumper wires for wiring

we used a bluetooth rc car smartphone app for control initially.


The repo here is opened for further development by community.
We have provided the 3D design blueprints for printing the body and wheels via a 3D printer. 

The project is developed by : Adamas Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Lab, Adamas University, Kolkata, India.
People involved in this project are: Tanmay Chakraborty, Sazid Ali, Akash Kumar, Ritam Mukherjee, Parijat Amin, and Subhadeep Pahari.
